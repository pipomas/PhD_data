Data and scripts
================

This repository contains data and scripts you need to reproduce the results reported in repository [PhD\_thesis](https://github.com/pipomas/PhD_thesis).

### Prerequisites

-   Download this repository by clicking on the green "*Clone or download*" button in the top right corner, and [set the downloaded folder as your R working directory](http://rfunction.com/archives/1001).
-   ...

### TODO: Adjust path to your directory

This will get updated, as soon as possible.
